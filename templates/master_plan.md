# **[Project Name]: Master Implementation Plan (v1)**

This document outlines the high-level, phased plan for building the **[Project Name]** **[Project Type, e.g., SaaS Platform, PWA]**. It serves as the single source of truth for the development roadmap, guiding the team through each stage of implementation from initial setup to deployment readiness. The successful completion of all phases will result in a fully functional, production-ready application.

## The Plan

### `[ ]` Phase A: Project Setup & Initial Scaffolding

**Goal:** Execute all initial project setup, including environment configuration, dependency installation, and boilerplate removal. Scaffold all primary pages, routes, and the foundational folder structure required for the application. The output will be a clean, prepared codebase ready for feature implementation.

---

### `[ ]` Phase B: Static Component Implementation

**Goal:** Systematically build all new, static, and reusable UI components required by the project's core features (e.g., custom forms, data display cards, navigation elements). Integrate these components into the scaffolded pages from Phase A, **using mock or hardcoded data** to ensure the UI is developed independently and rapidly.

---

### `[ ]` Phase C: Theming & Visual Polish

**Goal:** Implement the application's design system, including light/dark mode functionality, typography, color palettes, and spacing. Conduct a full visual review to refine styling, ensuring a cohesive and polished look and feel across all components and pages.

- _[Link to a detailed breakdown document, e.g., `./docs/phases/phase-c-theming-and-polish.md`]_

---

### `[ ]` Phase D: Database Schema & Seeding

**Goal:** Establish the application's data layer. This involves implementing the final database schema using an ORM like Prisma, running the initial database migration, and creating seed scripts to populate the database with essential starting data (e.g., default settings, plan types, initial admin user).

- _[Link to a detailed breakdown document, e.g., `./docs/phases/phase-d-database-schema.md`]_

---

### `[ ]` Phase E: Core Feature API Implementation

**Goal:** Build the essential backend API routes (or server actions) for all core user-facing features. This includes the complete business logic and CRUD operations for **[Main Feature 1], [Main Feature 2], and [Main Feature 3]**, ensuring all routes are protected by the chosen authentication strategy.

- _[Link to a detailed breakdown document, e.g., `./docs/phases/phase-e-core-api.md`]_

---

### `[ ]` Phase F: Frontend API Integration

**Goal:** Make the application fully dynamic by connecting the static frontend to the live backend. This involves **replacing all mock data** in the UI with live data fetched from the API, using a server-state library (e.g., `@tanstack/react-query`) for data fetching, caching, mutations, and optimistic updates.

- _[Link to a detailed breakdown document, e.g., `./docs/phases/phase-f-frontend-integration.md`]_

---

### `[ ]` Phase G: Monetization & Billing Integration

**Goal:** Implement the complete monetization lifecycle by integrating with a payment provider like Stripe. This includes creating checkout sessions for subscriptions or purchases, providing a customer portal for management, and building a secure webhook endpoint to synchronize billing status with the application database.

- _[Link to a detailed breakdown document, e.g., `./docs/phases/phase-g-billing-integration.md`]_

---

### `[ ]` Phase H: Backend Automation & Advanced Services

**Goal:** Build the automated and asynchronous systems that power the app's unique value. This includes implementing any **[Key Automated Process #1, e.g., data ingestion pipelines]** and **[Key Automated Process #2, e.g., notification/email scheduling engines]**, leveraging cron jobs and external service APIs.

- _[Link to a detailed breakdown document, e.g., `./docs/phases/phase-h-backend-automation.md`]_

---

### `[ ]` Phase I: Admin Dashboard & Internal Tooling

**Goal:** Develop the necessary internal tools for application management. This involves building a secure admin dashboard where authorized users can **[Admin Task #1, e.g., manage users]**, **[Admin Task #2, e.g., review and publish content]**, and monitor application health.

- _[Link to a detailed breakdown document, e.g., `./docs/phases/phase-i-admin-dashboard.md`]_

---

### `[ ]` Phase J: Final Testing & Deployment Preparation

**Goal:** Ensure the application is stable, secure, and ready for production. This includes end-to-end manual testing of all user flows, writing key integration tests, setting up production-grade observability (error tracking, logging), and configuring all production environment variables for deployment.

- _[Link to a detailed breakdown document, e.g., `./docs/phases/phase-j-testing-and-deployment.md`]_
