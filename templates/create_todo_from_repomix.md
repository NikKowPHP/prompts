Here are the tasks based on your conversation:

### **High Priority / Core Functionality**
- **Require User Account for Booking:** Change the booking flow so that a client must sign up or log in to book a session with a trainer.
- **Trainer Comments on Client Workouts:** Implement a feature allowing trainers to add comments to a client's completed workout log. This is a direct request for feedback and engagement.
- **Enhanced Trainer Search & Filtering:** Prioritize and ensure the trainer search and filtering functionality is robust and fast, as this is the most critical feature for clients.

### **Feature Development**
- **Attach Videos/GIFs to Exercises:**
    - Allow trainers to link a YouTube video or upload a GIF for each exercise in a template.
    - When a client views the shared workout, they can see the visual demonstration of the exercise.
- **Pre-built Workout Templates:** Create a library of basic, pre-built workout templates that new trainers can use immediately upon signing up to get started quickly.
- **Strength Coach Assessment Module:**
    - Develop a feature for creating and tracking specialized fitness tests (e.g., Cooper test, vertical jump, VO2 max).
    - Allow trainers to record a client's baseline results and track their progress over time after a training block (e.g., after 6 weeks).

### **Future/Wishlist Features**
- **Holistic Health Tracking:** Consider adding modules for clients to track their diet, sleep, and stress levels.
- **Trainer Blog Functionality:** Explore adding a feature for trainers to write and publish articles on their public profiles to showcase their expertise.
