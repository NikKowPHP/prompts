# **[Project Name]: Technical Application Description (v1)**

## 1. Vision & Architectural Philosophy

**[Project Name]** is a **[Project Type, e.g., Progressive Web App, SaaS Platform, Mobile App]** designed to **[One-Sentence Elevator Pitch]**. Our architecture prioritizes **[Key Architectural Priority #1, e.g., developer experience, scalability, performance]**, **[Key Architectural Priority #2, e.g., end-to-end type-safety, rapid iteration]**, and a **[Key User Experience Goal, e.g., seamless user journey, mobile-first interface]**.

The core philosophy is to **[Describe the fundamental "why" behind the project]**. We believe that **[Elaborate on the core belief or the problem being solved]**. This application is designed not as a **[thing it is NOT, e.g., a simple utility]**, but as a **[Metaphor for its purpose, e.g., scaffolding tool, digital co-pilot, creative canvas]** to help users **[achieve a specific outcome or transformation]**.

Furthermore, we are committed to **[A core value, e.g., accessibility, data privacy, open source]**. Our **[Business Model or Core Strategy, e.g., value-based freemium model, B2B licensing model]** directly addresses this by ensuring that **[describe how the model supports the value, e.g., core features are always free, user data is never sold]**. The premium tier or primary business model funds the app's continued development and offers **[describe the value proposition of the paid/core offering]**.

## 2. Architectural Overview

The system is designed around a **[Key Architectural Pattern, e.g., clean separation of concerns, microservices architecture, serverless-first approach]** within a **[Codebase Structure, e.g., Next.js monorepo, multi-repo setup]**. This approach leverages **[Primary Technology #1, e.g., server components for performance]** and **[Primary Technology #2, e.g., dedicated API services for backend logic]**, creating a cohesive yet modular development environment.

```

**Flow Description:**

1.  **Client:** The user interacts with the **[Frontend Framework]** frontend, which handles the user interface.
2.  **Authentication & Storage:** **[Auth & Storage Provider]** provides a complete solution for user management (Auth) and file storage (Storage).
3.  **Application Backend:** Core business logic resides here in our **[Backend Implementation, e.g., Next.js API Routes, NestJS App]**. These endpoints are protected by **[Auth Mechanism, e.g., JWT verification]**.
4.  **Database Interaction:** **[ORM/DB Client, e.g., Prisma, Drizzle]** acts as the type-safe layer between our application logic and the **[Database Type, e.g., PostgreSQL]** database.
5.  **Payment Processing:** **[Payment Provider, e.g., Stripe]** handles all payment and subscription management. Our backend listens to webhooks to sync state.
6.  **Asynchronous Tasks:** Background tasks like **[Example Task #1, e.g., sending push notifications]** and **[Example Task #2, e.g., processing data]** are handled by **[System for Async Tasks, e.g., Vercel Cron Jobs, a message queue like RabbitMQ]**.

## 5. Monetization Strategy: [Chosen Model]

The app uses a **[Model Name, e.g., Freemium, Subscription, One-Time Purchase]** model integrated with **[Payment Provider]**. Our primary strategy is to **[Describe the core monetization strategy, e.g., attract a wide user base with a free tier and convert dedicated users to a premium plan]**.

| Tier              | Price                      | Key Features                                                                                            | Target Audience                                     |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Tier 1 Name]** | [Price, e.g., $0]          | [List 2-3 key features or limitations for this tier.]                                                   | [Describe the target user for this tier.]           |

## 6. High-Level Database Schema

_This is a simplified, representative schema. The actual implementation will evolve._

```prisma
// Example Prisma Schema
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "[e.g., postgresql]"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

// The primary user model, linked to your auth provider and subscription.
model User {
  id             String    @id @default(uuid())
  email          String    @unique
  name           String?
  authProviderId String    @unique @map("auth_provider_id")

  stripeCustomerId String?   @unique @map("stripe_customer_id")
  subscriptionTier String    @default("FREE")

  // Timestamps
  createdAt      DateTime  @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt      DateTime  @updatedAt @map("updated_at")

  // Relations to other models
  posts          Post[]
}

// Example of a core content model in your application.
model Post {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  title     String
  content   String   @db.Text
  status    String   @default("DRAFT") // DRAFT, PUBLISHED
  isPremium Boolean  @default(false) @map("is_premium")

  authorId  String
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")
}

// ... other models like Subscription, Team, etc. ...
```

## 8. Development & Compliance Practices

### 8.1. UI/UX Philosophy

The application will be built with a **[e.g., mobile-first, desktop-first]** philosophy. All UI will be designed for the **[smallest/target]** viewport first, then progressively enhanced for other screen sizes using **[CSS Framework]'s** responsive breakpoints.

### 8.2. Code Quality & Best Practices

- **Folder Structure:** We will follow a **[describe the chosen folder structure, e.g., feature-based, layer-based]** structure.
- **Component Scoping:** We will default to **[e.g., Server Components]**, opting into **[e.g., Client Components]** only when interactivity is required.
- **Type Safety:** We will use **[Schema/Type Tool #1, e.g., Zod]** and **[Schema/Type Tool #2, e.g., Prisma]** to ensure end-to-end type safety.
- **Environment Variables:** Env vars will be validated on application start-up using **[Schema Tool, e.g., Zod]**.

### 8.3. Accessibility (A11y)

- **Goal:** The application will strive to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.
- **Implementation:** We will use semantic HTML, ensure full keyboard navigability, provide appropriate ARIA attributes, and test with screen readers. Using **[Component Library, e.g., shadcn/ui]** provides a strong, accessible foundation.

### 8.4. Observability Strategy

- **Error Tracking:** We will integrate **[Error Tracking Service, e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag]** to capture and report all unhandled exceptions.
- **Performance Monitoring:** We will leverage **[Analytics Service, e.g., Vercel Analytics, Google Analytics]** to monitor Core Web Vitals.
- **Structured Logging:** Key backend processes (especially automated pipelines) will use structured logging, drained to **[Log Management Service, e.g., Axiom, Datadog]** for debugging and tracing.

## 9. MVP Scope & Phasing

Our immediate goal is to launch an MVP that validates the core user proposition: **[State the core hypothesis you are testing with the MVP]**.

### Phase 1: MVP (Target: [Date/Quarter])

- **Focus:** Core user authentication, the primary free-tier user flow, and the premium upgrade path.
- **Epics to be Completed:** Epic 1, Epic 2, Epic 4, and the core stories from Epic 3.

### Phase 2: Post-MVP (First Major Update)

- **Focus:** Enhancing the premium offering with interactive and high-value features.
- **Epics to be Implemented:** The remaining stories from Epic 3, Epic 5 (Admin tools), and any new high-priority epics.
