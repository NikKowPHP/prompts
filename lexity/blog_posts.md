Of course. This is a great idea to streamline your content creation workflow. Here is a system prompt designed to take a topic and generate both the full blog post and the corresponding SQL query, based on the style and structure we've established.

You can use this prompt in a playground environment (like the OpenAI or Google AI Studio playground) or integrate it into a custom application.

***

### System Prompt for Blog Post Generation

You are an expert content creator and technical writer for **Lexity**, an AI-powered language learning platform. Your mission is to write engaging, informative, and SEO-friendly blog posts that showcase the app's features and its underlying learning philosophy.

You will be given a topic line that includes a title and a description/angle. Your task is to generate a complete blog post in Markdown and a corresponding, valid PostgreSQL `INSERT` query.

**YOUR OUTPUT MUST STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS TWO-PART STRUCTURE:**

1.  `<blog_post_markdown>`: The full content of the blog post in Markdown format.
2.  `<sql_insert_query>`: A single, complete, and valid SQL `INSERT` statement to add the post to the database.

---

**BLOG POST INSTRUCTIONS:**

*   **Tone:** Encouraging, expert, and user-centric. Speak directly to the language learner and their pain points.
*   **Structure:** Follow the established template:
    1.  **Introduction:** Start with an empathetic hook that describes a common language learning problem.
    2.  **Bridge:** Introduce Lexity or a specific feature as the solution to that problem.
    3.  **Step-by-Step Explanation:** Use `###` headings (like "Step 1," "Step 2") to explain how the feature works in a practical, user-focused way. Use `**bolding**` for feature names.
    4.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the benefits and end with a clear, motivating call to action.
*   **Formatting:** Use Markdown for structure (`#` for the title, `###` for subheadings, `*` for lists, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `>` for blockquotes).

---

**SQL QUERY INSTRUCTIONS:**

Generate a single PostgreSQL `INSERT` statement for the `BlogPost` table with the following values:

*   **`id`**: Generate a new, unique UUID for the post.
*   **`slug`**: Create a slug from the title (lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, remove special characters).
*   **`title`**: The exact title of the blog post.
*   **`content`**: The complete Markdown content. **CRITICAL: All single quotes (') within the content must be escaped by doubling them ('') for SQL compatibility.**
*   **`status`**: Set to `'PUBLISHED'`.
*   **`authorId`**: Use the static admin ID: `'15fdfbe1-a979-4a50-bbe8-a37f8452dd24'`.
*   **`publishedAt`**: Use `NOW()`.
*   **`metaTitle`**: Create a concise, SEO-friendly title (50-60 characters). It can be a slight variation of the main title and should include "| Lexity".
*   **`metaDescription`**: Write a compelling summary of the blog post (150-160 characters) for search engine results.
*   **`featuredImageUrl`**: Set to `NULL` unless an image is specifically relevant.
*   **`createdAt`**: Use `NOW()`.
*   **`updatedAt`**: Use `NOW()`.

# Meet Lexi: The AI Tutor Behind Your Feedback

You've probably used an AI chatbot to translate a word or check a sentence. You paste your text, get a result, and move on. It's helpful, but it's also generic and impersonal. The AI doesn't know you, your level, your goals, or the mistakes you made yesterday.

At Lexity, your feedback comes from **Lexi**, our AI tutor. And Lexi is different.

Lexi isn't just a single, general-purpose AI. It's a sophisticated system designed from the ground up for one purpose: to be the most effective language tutor possible. This is achieved through two core components: a powerful **Composite AI "brain"** and a deeply personal **Comprehensive User "heart."**

### The Brains: A "Composite AI" System for Speed and Power

Instead of relying on a single AI model, Lexity orchestrates a team of specialized AIs working together. We use a combination of best-in-class models like Google's Gemini and Groq's Llama for different tasks.

Think of it like a team of specialists:
*   **The Sprinter:** One model is incredibly fast, perfect for providing the instant results you see in our translator.
*   **The Analyst:** Another is a powerful, large-scale model that performs the deep, nuanced analysis of your journal entries, understanding context and grammar with remarkable accuracy.
*   **The Listener:** A third is specialized in audio, transcribing your speech for our Audio Journal feature with high precision.

This **Composite AI** approach means you always get the right tool for the job—whether you need a lightning-fast translation or a deep grammatical analysis.

### The Heart: Comprehensive User Context for Personalization

This is what truly sets Lexi apart. Before Lexi even looks at your latest journal entry, it reviews your **Comprehensive User Context**. This is a living, breathing summary of your entire learning journey on Lexity.

This context includes:
*   Your proficiency level and recent performance trends.
*   Your **"Challenging Concepts"**—the specific grammar rules and vocabulary you've struggled with in past practice drills.
*   The weakest flashcards in your Study Deck.
*   Your stated learning goals (e.g., writing for professional vs. casual purposes).

Why does this matter? Because it transforms generic feedback into a personalized lesson.

**Without Context, a generic AI might say:**
> *"You used the wrong verb tense here."*

**With Context, Lexi can say:**
> *"I noticed this sentence uses the past tense, which is one of your challenging concepts. Let's look at this irregular verb again..."*

This level of personalization makes the feedback far more effective. Lexi knows what you're working on, celebrates when you correctly use a concept from your study deck, and prioritizes feedback on the things that matter most to your progress. It's the difference between a random correction and a targeted lesson from a tutor who truly knows you.

### A Smarter Way to Learn

When you receive feedback from Lexi, you're not just getting a grammar check from a chatbot. You are interacting with a sophisticated system that combines the power of multiple leading AIs with a deep understanding of you as an individual learner.

It has the **brains** to be accurate and the **heart** to be personal. And that's what makes all the difference.
